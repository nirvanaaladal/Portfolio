# Abstract
Sports have expanded over time, with development not only in competition but also in research. Sport studies are inextricably linked to its inherent aspects such as physical fitness, performance, and production. In this project, information on the integration of wearable devices to enhance athletic performance tracking has been gathered from subfields of research. Although there are multiple wearable technologies available on the global market to aid in sports activities, they have various limitations. Despite Qatar being one of the most forward-looking and advanced athletic nations on the globe, wearable devices are scarce in the Qatari market. Zooming in on the impediments of the existing products, one major evident setback is the lack of a communication system embedded into the wearable. Communication is crucial in sports. Coaches guide their players to ensure that they are functioning to their full capacity, which frequently necessitates immediate communication during physical activity.

Intellicoach, a low-cost, user-friendly wearable gadget designed to help coaches and athletes, will be created as part of this project. The major function of this gadget, which is designed to be worn on the chest, is to gather data on an athlete's activities and relay it to the coach, while also allowing for immediate real-time communication between the two. The device has a GPS to track the athlete's location and movement, a number of sensors working with artificial intelligence to measure heart rate and perform gait analysis, and a microphone and a speaker for real-time communication with the coach. This data is then wirelessly sent to the coach's portable through Wi-Fi. The coach may then watch an analysis of the athletes' activities while communicating with them via the handheld microphone and speaker. Due to the limitations of existing wearable sports devices, which range from high prices to a lack of necessary features, and even the fact that such devices are not available in Qatar, it is clear that Intellicoach has the potential to be adopted by the Qatari and international sports markets, as it will not only be the only wearable sports device available for an affordable price in the Qatari market, but it will also cover for the shortcomings that the existing devices have.
