## Plant monitoring system

# Problem Statement
Plants are a big part of day-to-day life, from food to being used for aesthetic purposes. Keeping plants thriving needs a lot of time and effort, like knowing
This project aims:
• This system can regulate plant water intake based on sensors attached to the plant
that can read the soil moisture level and determine whether or not it needs water.
• This system can read the temperature and humidity surrounding the plant and send
real-time data to the user.
The system will be built to read sensors, and based on the readings, it will control the water flow with a pump. The readings will be sent to the main board, which acts as a user interface so the user can know the plant parameters. All of the stated functions and connections will be built with the following structure:
ignored, or in some cases, dealing with big fields with different water absorbance levels in
when and how much
water to provide plants. Today’s fast-paced lifestyle causes plant maintenance to be
different parts of the field, causing some plants to be watered more than others which
affects the crop yield.
