## Iot Networks Intrusion Detection Using Machine Learning
# Abstract— 
Intrusion detection is essential because of the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being used in various applications, which has raised the danger of security risks. In IoT networks, the usage of machine learning (ML) techniques for intrusion detection is on the rise. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of four popular machine learning (ML) methods for detecting intrusions in Internet of Things networks: Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Deep Learning, and Naïve Bayes. Using a dataset of network traffic data, we assess these algorithms' performance using a variety of performance criteria, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our results demonstrate that all four algorithms are capable of reliably identifying intrusions in IoT networks, with deep learning showing the best accuracy and F1-score. The intrusion detection system's unique needs, such as the type of data being used and the available computing power, ultimately determine which method is used. Possibilities for improving the security of IoT installations are presented by the development of ML-based intrusion detection systems for IoT networks.
