## Tomato Leaf Plant Disease Detection using Image processing 

# Abstract:
This project focuses on developing a system that utilizes machine learning for detecting the health status of tomato plants. The aim is to accurately classify plant images into two categories: healthy or unhealthy, allowing for early disease detection and preventative measures to reduce crop losses. The dataset includes images of tomato plant leaves acquired at Qatar University's Farmhouse. Image processing techniques are used to preprocess the images and improve their features. A machine learning algorithm is then utilized to classify the preprocessed images to healthy and unhealthy categories. For model evaluation, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. Performance metrics, such as a confusion matrix, are computed to evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm in disease detection. The proposed system provides a reliable and rapid solution for automated plant disease diagnosis, empowering farmers to take timely protective measures for their crops. Overall, this project contributes significantly to plant disease detection and has practical implications over the agricultural sector.
